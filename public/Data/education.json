    "question": "How often should I visit the dentist?",
    "answer": "It’s recommended to visit your dentist every 6 months for a check-up and cleaning. Regular visits allow your dentist to catch problems early, prevent gum disease, and maintain healthy teeth. In some cases, like if you have braces or gum issues, your dentist may suggest more frequent visits."

  {
    "id": 2,
    "question": "What’s the best way to brush my teeth?",
    "answer": "Brush for at least 2 minutes, twice a day, using a soft-bristled toothbrush. Hold the brush at a 45-degree angle to your gums and use gentle circular motions to clean all surfaces of your teeth. Don’t forget your tongue, and always use fluoride toothpaste to protect against cavities."
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "question": "How can I prevent cavities?",
    "answer": "Preventing cavities comes down to consistent oral hygiene and healthy habits. Brush twice daily, floss once a day to remove food between teeth, and use fluoride toothpaste. Limiting sugary snacks and drinks also lowers your risk. Regular dental checkups ensure small cavities are caught early before they grow."

    "question": "Is gum bleeding normal?",
    "answer": "Bleeding gums are often a sign of gingivitis, which is an early stage of gum disease. This can happen if plaque builds up along the gum line. Occasional light bleeding after flossing may be normal, but persistent bleeding should not be ignored. Visit your dentist to rule out gum infection or other conditions."
  },

    "id": 5,
    "question": "What foods are good for dental health?",
    "answer": "Calcium-rich foods like milk, cheese, and yogurt strengthen tooth enamel. Crunchy fruits and vegetables, such as apples and carrots, help clean your teeth naturally and stimulate saliva flow. Leafy greens and nuts provide vitamins and minerals that support gum health. Drinking water also helps wash away bacteria."

    "question": "Are electric toothbrushes better?",
    "answer": "Electric toothbrushes can remove more plaque compared to manual brushes, especially for people with limited hand movement or children who brush too quickly. They often come with built-in timers to encourage proper brushing. However, a manual toothbrush works just as well if used correctly with the right technique."
  },
  {
    "id": 7,
    "question": "What causes bad breath?",
    "answer": "Bad breath, or halitosis, is often caused by bacteria in the mouth breaking down leftover food particles. Poor brushing, gum disease, and dry mouth can make it worse. Certain foods like garlic and onions also contribute. If bad breath persists despite good oral care, consult your dentist to check for underlying issues."

    "question": "Do whitening products damage teeth?",
    "answer": "Most over-the-counter whitening products are safe when used correctly, but excessive use can cause tooth sensitivity and irritate your gums. Professional whitening under a dentist’s supervision is safer and more effective. Always follow the instructions and avoid unverified DIY remedies that can weaken enamel."
  },
  {
    "id": 9,
    "question": "Why do I get tooth sensitivity?",
    "answer": "Tooth sensitivity often happens when enamel wears down, exposing the softer dentin layer underneath. It can also be caused by cavities, gum recession, or grinding your teeth. You may feel discomfort when eating hot, cold, or sweet foods. Using desensitizing toothpaste and seeing a dentist can help manage the condition."
  },
  {
    "id": 10,
    "question": "How can I protect my teeth from grinding at night?",
    "answer": "Grinding, also known as bruxism, can wear down your teeth and cause jaw pain or headaches. Wearing a custom night guard, made by your dentist, is one of the best ways to protect your teeth. Managing stress, avoiding caffeine late at night, and maintaining a proper sleep routine can also reduce grinding."

    "question": "What age should kids see a dentist?",
    "answer": "Children should visit the dentist by their first birthday or within 6 months of their first tooth erupting. Early visits help ensure proper development of teeth and allow parents to receive guidance on brushing, nutrition, and habits like thumb-sucking. Starting young also helps kids feel comfortable at the dentist."
  },
  {
    "id": 12,
    "question": "Do I really need to floss?",
    "answer": "Yes, flossing is an essential part of oral hygiene. It removes food particles and plaque from between your teeth and under the gumline where your toothbrush can’t reach. Daily flossing helps prevent cavities, reduces the risk of gum disease, and keeps your breath fresh. Skipping flossing leaves nearly half your mouth uncleaned."
